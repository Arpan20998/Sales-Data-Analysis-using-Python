# 📊 Sales Data Analysis with Python

This project is a Sales Data Analysis performed using Python to derive business insights from historical sales data. The objective is to analyze trends, customer behavior, and product performance to support data-driven decision-making.

# 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I answered the following key business questions using real-world sales data:

Q1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Q2. Which city had the highest number of sales?

Q3. What time should advertisements be displayed to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases?

Q4. What products are most often sold together?

Q5. What product sold the most ?

The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insight extraction.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib – for visualizations

OS – for file management

Glob – to read multiple CSV files

itertools.combinations and collections.Counter – to find frequently bought product pairs

# 📈 Key Insights
Identified the best-performing month in terms of sales.

Discovered the top cities contributing to the revenue.

Found the optimal time to run advertisements for maximum customer engagement.

Analyzed product bundling to find combinations often purchased together.

Highlighted the top-selling product and reasons for its high demand.

# 📂 Dataset
The data used consists of monthly sales records stored in multiple CSV files. Each file contains information like:

Order ID

Product

Quantity Ordered

Price Each

Order Date

Purchase Address

Note: This project assumes all monthly CSV files are located in a folder and are merged using glob.
